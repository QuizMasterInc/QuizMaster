### MVP 
   
A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a product that lies at the intersection of minimal development effort, high product quality, and peaked user interest. More specifically, an MVP can serve as a sort of test to see if users will enjoy a product, whether the development of that product should continue, and what can be improved about the product. As members of the scrum team, Team Fun, we plan to use the MVP to help receive user feedback and improve our product.  
  
The product we will be working toward delivering is QuizMaster, a web application that currently allows users to take quizzes from various categories. Our MVP will consist of a polished, aesthetically pleasing web app that works well on desktop and mobile devices with many quiz-taking options. There will be at least five categories of quizzes–each containing smaller subcategories of more niche quizzes–provided directly by our team, and users will have the ability to create their own quizzes so that they can study material that is more relevant or interesting to them. Additionally, these quizzes will be randomized by pulling ten questions from a database containing dozens of options for possible questions. Each quiz question will have one correct answer out of four possibilities, and at the end of the quiz, the user will be able to see what they got wrong. 
  
The previous team’s version of QuizMaster is rather exceptional, but there are still many improvements to be made that will make QuizMaster stand out even more. The biggest improvement we will implement is allowing users to create their own quizzes. Currently, this is not a feature of QuizMaster, but we predict it will likely be most users’ primary purpose for using our product. Additionally, the current iteration of QuizMaster has setbacks like non-randomized quizzes, lengthy and stale quizzes, and some incorrect answers stored in the database. To freshen up the default quizzes offered on the website, we will shorten the quiz length to just ten questions rather than twenty. We will also be altering the structure of our database and data therein, so it is possible to query for main categories and subcategories, and to get a random selection of all possible questions. Moreover, we will be correcting any pre-existing wrong answers we find.  
  
Another key component of our MVP will be Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. We will have separate branches for our production and testing environments. We will also host those environments separately. When we complete a section of code, we will push it to our testing branch so we can ensure it is working as we intended. Then, we will push it to our production branch when it is ready for our end users.  
  
As we continue to improve QuizMaster, we will use the same tech stack the previous team used: React, TailwindCSS, Firebase authentication, Firebase Firestore, and Google Cloud Functions with Go. The previous team did an exceptional job creating this service, and few structural changes will have to be made. Adding the improved functionality outlined here should be challenging but still achievable.
