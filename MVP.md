### MVP 
   
An MVP (Minimum viable product) is the stage of a product where there is just enough of the features implemented that customers and investors can get a look at the core features and give feedback on whether the features are up to the standards of the customers and if there are different things they are wanting that is the stage of development for them to say something. Having the ability to understand the user base without having to fully develop a product will allow the developer to better appeal to their customers, and give them the knowledge of whether creating such a product would be worth creating or not. This gives a good understanding of how much support would be needed financially as well.

The product we will be developing this semester is QuizMaster, it is a web application to allow the creation of Quizzes and allowing consumers to take the quizzes and receive feedback on how well they did. Our MVP will consist of creating a refined QuizMaster that wont take much time to fix up but will still be able to provide value to the user. It will be a version of the old product but with added structure in order to provide something new to the user. To do this, we will finish up what the previous team had started and we will continue to work on the web app until we feel as a customer that it gives us something new to do. This might mean giving new quiz categories, new quiz questions, refining the difficulty of questions, adding more user friendly settings, and making it easier to navigate through the web page.

The previous team did a great job getting Quizmaster to look very polished, as well as the completion of the custom quiz creation, now they did a great job with designing and implementing it but it can use more refining such as when searching for quizzes to make it more organized and appealing to look at. The needs of the user are of great importance since this application can be used for academic purposes as well as a way for users to have fun with it. Navigation through the UI is important for there not to be any confusion for the user. It is also important that the application is very presentable. The continuous improvement of the UI can make development easier for current and future teams. 

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery is always at the forefront of the consistent improvements being made for the application. Maintaining this practice will make for a better application as well as allowing for better communication within the team. As a team, it will be important to be testing each new implementation of the MVP we intend on creating. This is to ensure the functionality of the application which will eventually lead to the delivery of the application to our end users.
